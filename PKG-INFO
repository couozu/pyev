Description: Python libev interface.
        
        libev is an event loop: you register interest in certain events (such as a file
        descriptor being readable or a timeout occurring), and it will manage these
        event sources and provide your program with events.
        To do this, it must take more or less complete control over your process (or
        thread) by executing the event loop handler, and will then communicate events
        via a callback mechanism.
        You register interest in certain events by registering so-called event watchers,
        which you initialise with the details of the event, and then hand over to libev
        by starting the watcher.
        
        libev supports ``select``, ``poll``, the Linux-specific ``epoll``, the
        BSD-specific ``kqueue`` and the Solaris-specific ``event port`` mechanisms for
        file descriptor events (:py:class:`Io`), Linux ``eventfd``/``signalfd`` (for
        faster and cleaner inter-thread wakeup (:py:class:`Async`)/signal handling
        (:py:class:`Signal`)), relative timers (:py:class:`Timer`), absolute timers
        (:py:class:`Periodic`), timers with customised rescheduling
        (:py:class:`Scheduler`), synchronous signals (:class:`Signal`), process status
        change events (:py:class:`Child`), and event watchers dealing with the event
        loop mechanism itself (:py:class:`Idle`, :py:class:`Embed`, :py:class:`Prepare`
        and :py:class:`Check` watchers) and even limited support
        for fork events (:py:class:`Fork`).
        
        It also is quite `fast <http://libev.schmorp.de/bench.html>`_.
        
        libev is written and maintained by Marc Lehmann.
